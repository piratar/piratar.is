== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a shortcode available for The Events Calendar? =

No, this plugin does not use a shortcode nor is one available at the time being. However, the premium add-on Events Calendar PRO comes with <a href="http://m.tri.be/18wh">widget shortcodes</a> that allow you to post any PRO widget (including the mini calendar) into a post or page.

= Are there any troubleshooting steps you'd suggest I try that might resolve my issue before I post a new thread? =

First, make sure that you're running the latest version of The Events Calendar (4.0 as of this release). If you're running Events Calendar PRO it needs to match the version number of The Events Calendar. And if you've got any other add-ons, make sure those are current / running the latest code as well.

The most common issues we see are either plugin or theme conflicts. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just The Events Calendar is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default Twenty Fourteen theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you'll know that is the source of the conflict.

Note that we aren't going to say "tough luck" if you identify a plugin/theme conflict. While we can't guarantee 100% integration with any plugin or theme out there, we will do our best (and reach out the plugin/theme author as needed) to figure out a solution that benefits everyone.

= I'm still stuck. Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question? =

Users of the free The Events Calendar should post their questions in the plugin's <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/the-events-calendar/">WordPress.org forum</a>, which we hit about once a week (usually on Wednesdays). Please make sure to read <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/welcome-the-events-calendar-users-read-this-first">our sticky post</a> providing an overview of the support we provide free users BEFORE posting. If you find you're not getting support in as timely a fashion as you wish, you might want to consider purchasing a PRO license.

If you're already a PRO user, you're entitled access to our more actively-monitored <a href="http://m.tri.be/2r">Events Calendar PRO forum</a> on our website. We can provide a deeper level of support here and hit these forums on a daily basis during the work week. Generally, except in times of increased support loads, we reply to all comments within 24-48 hours during the business week.

= Events Calendar PRO looks awesome! I'm sold! How can I get my hands on it? =

Events Calendar PRO can be purchased directly on <a href="http://m.tri.be/18wi">our website.</a> There are five (5) license types available, and all licenses include 1 year of access to support + updates.

= I'm interested in PRO or another add-on, but there are a few questions I've got before making the purchase. Can you help me get those addressed? =

Absolutely. If you're not finding your questions answered on the product pages, hit up our <a href="http://m.tri.be/2w">pre-sales forum</a> on our site. You can save yourself some time by reviewing the threads first to verify if your question has already been asked. If it hasn't, post a new thread as a guest. We'll get you a reply as quickly as we can, so you can make an informed decision regarding purchase.

= What add-ons are available for The Events Calendar, and where can I read more about them? =

== Versioning ==

Curious about our versioning process, and how it's changed since The Events Calendar 3.0's launch? Look no further.

As a general practice, version numbers for The Events Calendar, Events Calendar PRO and our other add-ons follows the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning#Semantic_versioning">Semantic Versioning guidelines</a> whenever practical.

This means releases will maintain a three-part version number: major version; minor version; and patch. Let's say we're looking at The Events Calendar 3.1, as an example:

Major version = 3
Minor version = 1
Patch = 0

If we deployed a follow-up maintenance build that addressed a couple small bugs, and called it 3.1.1, we'd now have:

Major version = 3
Minor version = 1
Patch = 1

At no point during the 3.0 lifecycle will the major version change. But you can expect that either minor version and/or patch will change with each release.

We hit the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/the-events-calendar/">The Events Calendar forum here on WordPress.org</a> about once a week, assisting users with basic troubleshooting and identifying bugs that have been reported. (If you are looking for more active support, might we suggest buying a PRO license? Our team hits the <a href="http://m.tri.be/2r">PRO forums</a> daily.)

Some things to consider before posting on the forum:

* Look through existing threads before posting a new one and check that there isn't already a discussion going on your issue.
* Your issue will be solved more quickly if you run a few checks before making a support request. Deactivate your plugins one by one - if the issue is fixed by deactivating a plugin you know you've got a plugin conflict. To test your Theme, revert to the default Twenty Twelve Theme to see if you are still experiencing the problem. If not, your Theme is the issue. Please provide this information when making your supper request.
* Sometimes, just resetting your permalinks can fix the issue. Visit Events -> Settings -> Permalinks, save your permalinks with a different option and then save with your preferred choice again. This can solve events-related problems and can is worth a shot before creating a new thread.

Still not happy? Shoot us an email to pro@tri.be or tweet to @moderntribeinc and tell us why. We'll do what we can to make it right.
